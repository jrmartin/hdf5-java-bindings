This OSGi bundle has been prepared for use of the HDF libraries in Eclipse project.

The compiled package for hdf-java 2.7 as downloaded from www.hdfgroup.org 
on 2011-05-09 has been used as much as possible.

For the original license see COPYING.ncsa. This covers all jars and native libraries.

None of the other files (MANIFEST.MF etc.) contain intellectual property, so they are
free to use and distributed.
